I have an old Macbook Pro laptop - late 2013 model. Nothing is wrong with it; very few scratches, and it is not suffering from [staingate](https://www.macworld.com/article/671767/retina-macbook-pro-what-is-staingate-what-can-you-do-about-it.html). It can 8 MB memory, 500 GB disk and a four-core i5 CPU (2.6 GHz). Definitely not a monter laptop, but for reading email, browsing the internet, maintaining a blog and programming a bit, it is actually a good computer.

[Apple](https://apple.com) has decided it is too old. More than a year ago, Apple stopped pushing updates to my laptop. I don't have big issues with [MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) but most of the time I use a web browser (any can do), an editor (I prefer [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) and a shell. Instead of disposing a functioning laptop, I could try to do something else.

As I said, I don't have big issues with MacOS but I grew up with [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), and an old Macbook Pro can run Linux. Why not give it a chance? Putting [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) on hardware from Apple can only be called liberation.

For little more than two decades, [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org) has been my go-to Linux distribution. In fact my little home server is running [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org) to my satisfaction. First step to liberate my old Macbook Pro was to install [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org).
