## Emacsforum 2011

[Peter Toft](http://www.version2.dk/blogs/peter-toft) and I are in the process of preparing [Emacsforum 2011](http://www.emacsforum.dk/) with some help by Troels Henriksen (at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk/)) and Keld Simonsen (from [KLID](http://www.klid.dk/)). The program is almost ready for publication, so I will not say too much - but there will be something for scientists and developers. Even our [Evil Twin](http://www.vim.org/) will be represented.

The mini-conference takes place 12th November 2011 at DIKU. The is no conference fee - and there will be no benefits.

If you are using Emacs (and even XEmacs) and live in the Copenhagen area, Emacsforum is a good place to meet fellow users.
